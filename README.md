# Honest Tom's Dealership

*"...and if you sign today, we'll throw in an extended warranty!"*

In this assignment we'll be writing a collection of Ruby classes for a "car lot" application. We'll be able to create a car lot that contains both new and used cars for sale, and used cars may have damages recorded. We will *not* be writing the application interface itself &ndash; no `puts` or `gets` anywhere in your code. As the developer you can interact with your classes using `binding.pry` and test files.

## Guidelines

* Write test files for each of your classes in the `bin` directory. Add to and run your test files *frequently* to make sure all the pieces are still working together as you expect.
* Make frequent, logical, granular Git commits with descriptive messages.
* Use getters, setters, public methods, private methods, and class constants appropriately. Combine methods and use inheritance when needed to avoid duplication of code.

## Specifications

Think carefully about the order you'll want to build these in. For instance, it might make sense to leave `CarLot` for last, since it needs cars to function.

### `CarLot`
* has a name
* may have one or more cars
* can retrieve the "lot value" (total price of all cars on the lot)
* can retrieve a list of all cars matching a certain make, model, or year

### `Car`
* has a make, model, and year of manufacture
* has an MSRP (original retail price)
* has a value (MSRP modified by depreciation, taking the year of manufacture into account)
* all cars have a constant depreciation of 5% per year
* has a manager markup
* has a price (value modified by the manager markup)

### `UsedCar`
* has the same attributes as a new car
* has a mileage
* may have one or more damages (scuffed paint, missing hubcaps, etc.)
* has a value (same calculation as a new car, modified by mileage depreciation and the cost of all current damages)
* all used cars have a constant mileage depreciation of 1% per 10,000 miles (0.0001% per mile)

### `Damage`
* has a description
* has a cost (how much it would cost to repair)

## Extra Challenges

* Add the ability to mark cars as "sold". A sold car no longer contributes to the "lot value", but does contribute to a new "lot revenue" property. Methods on the car lot should allow retrieving either unsold or sold cars. The transition from unsold to sold should be *one-way*.
* Add an auto-generated unique ID for each car that is 1 higher than the ID of the last car created (starting at 1 for the first car). You'll need to use a class variable for this.
